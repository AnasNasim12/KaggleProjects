## Project 1 - Acronym Generator
### Overview
The Acronym Generator is a Python mini project aimed at generating acronyms from input phrases. It takes a user-provided phrase as input and generates an acronym by taking the first letter of each word in the phrase. The generated acronym is then displayed to the user.

#### Features
Input validation: Ensures that the user enters a valid phrase.
Error handling: Handles unexpected inputs gracefully and provides clear messages to the user.
Alphanumeric filtering: Ignores special characters and numbers in the input phrase.
Modular design: The code is organized into functions for better readability and maintainability.

# Kaggle Data Science Projects

This repository contains my exploratory data analysis and machine learning projects based on datasets from Kaggle. The aim is to showcase data wrangling, visualization, and predictive modeling skills.

## Projects Overview

- **Eminem's YouTube Stats Analysis**: An in-depth EDA on Eminem's music video performance on YouTube, exploring views distribution, upload frequency, video duration, and their relationships.

## Eminem's YouTube Stats Analysis

### Introduction

This project conducts a detailed exploratory data analysis on a dataset featuring Eminem's music video statistics from YouTube. The dataset includes video titles, publication dates, video durations, and view counts.

### Key Insights

- The view counts distribution is heavily skewed, with a few videos significantly outperforming others.
- Video uploads fluctuate over time, possibly correlating with album releases or significant events.
- There is no clear relationship between video duration and view counts, suggesting content quality and audience engagement play more significant roles.
- The dataset's statistical summary reveals high variability in view counts and video duration.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

### Getting Started

To replicate this analysis, ensure you have Python installed and the following libraries:

```shell
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
